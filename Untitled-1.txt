Mode	Name	                Syntax Example	Meaning
imp	Implied	                    CLC             The instruction does not take an operand; it implicitly operates on registers.
imm	Immediate	                LDA #$10	    Loads the value $10 into A (not an address).
zp	Zero Page	                LDA $20	        Loads from memory address $0020 (only the low byte is given).
abs	Absolute	                LDA $1000	    Loads from memory address $1000.
zpx	Zero Page,X	                LDA $20,X	    Loads from address $20 + X (wraps within page $00â€“$FF).
abx	Absolute,X	                LDA $1000,X     Loads from $1000 + X. Used for tables and loops.
zpy	Zero Page,Y	                LDA $20,Y	    Loads from $20 + Y (similar to ZPX but with Y).
aby	Absolute,Y	                LDA $1000,Y	    Loads from $1000 + Y, like Absolute,X but with Y.
inx	Indexed Indirect (X)	    LDA ($20,X)	    First, ($20 + X) gives an address stored in zero page, then loads from that address.
iny	Indirect Indexed (Y)	    LDA ($20),Y	    First, ($20) gives an address, then loads from address + Y.
ind	Indirect	                JMP ($1000)	    Jumps to the address stored at $1000 (used only by JMP).
acc	Accumulator	                LSR A	        Operates directly on the A register.
rel	Relative	                BEQ LABEL	    Used for branch instructions. The operand is an offset relative to the current PC.
